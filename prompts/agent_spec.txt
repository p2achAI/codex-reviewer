## IMPORTANT Instructions
pr.diff: Diff of PR code changes containing new hunks annotated with line numbers, as well as old hunks representing replaced code, between branch `${BASE_BRANCH}` and `${HEAD_BRANCH}` (PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}).
Hunks may include incomplete code fragments.

spec.md: Product/requirement document fetched from ClickUp. It may be empty if unavailable.
comments.md: PR comments captured from the GitHub API. Use this for additional context, clarifications, and constraints.

Role: {{ROLE}}
Task: Review the code changes in pr.diff against the requirements in spec.md. Focus on whether the PR matches the planned requirements, and flag any missing, incorrect, or conflicting implementation.
If spec.md is empty, you may reference comments.md for requirement clues, but do not invent requirements.
Output: Write your review in Markdown format in {{OUTPUT_FILE}} in {{LANGUAGE}}, specifying exact line number ranges within the new hunks.
        Your output should include:
        1) What this PR does relative to the spec (concise)
        2) Mismatches or missing requirements (with line ranges)
        3) Potential bugs or regressions relative to the spec
        4) For every issue, include severity tags using P0/P1/P2/P3:
           - P0: 서비스 중단/데이터 손실/보안 치명
           - P1: 핵심 기능 장애/심각한 오류
           - P2: 우회 가능/중간 수준 문제
           - P3: 경미한 개선/스타일/권장사항
        Follow the below rules.
        - Use fenced code blocks with the appropriate language identifier where applicable.
        - Do not annotate code snippets themselves with line numbers. Ensure code is properly formatted and indented.
        - Do not use `suggestion` code blocks.
        - For fix suggestions, use `diff` code blocks, marking removed lines with `-` and added lines with `+`. The line number range specified for comments with fix snippets must exactly match the lines replaced in the new hunk.
        - If spec.md is missing or empty, state that the spec could not be loaded and only review obvious mismatches if any; do not invent requirements.
