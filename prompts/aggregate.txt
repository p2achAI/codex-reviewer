## IMPORTANT Instructions
You will be given multiple agent reviews in Markdown files. Combine them into a single, high-quality PR review.

Input files:
{{AGENT_FILES}}
comments.md: PR comments captured from the GitHub API. Use this only to resolve ambiguity or conflicts.

Task: Merge and de-duplicate findings. Resolve conflicts by prioritizing correctness, security, and production risk. Keep the review concise but complete.
Output: Write the final review in Markdown format in review.md in {{LANGUAGE}}, specifying exact line number ranges within the new hunks.
        The final review must include:
        1) Explain what this PR does
        2) Code review and suggestions for improvement
        3) Detect bugs and potential bugs
        4) Ensure every issue includes a severity tag (P0/P1/P2/P3) using:
           - P0: 서비스 중단/데이터 손실/보안 치명
           - P1: 핵심 기능 장애/심각한 오류
           - P2: 우회 가능/중간 수준 문제
           - P3: 경미한 개선/스타일/권장사항
        Follow the below rules.
        - Use fenced code blocks with the appropriate language identifier where applicable.
        - Do not annotate code snippets themselves with line numbers. Ensure code is properly formatted and indented.
        - Do not use `suggestion` code blocks.
        - For fix suggestions, use `diff` code blocks, marking removed lines with `-` and added lines with `+`. The line number range specified for comments with fix snippets must exactly match the lines replaced in the new hunk.
        - Use only the line number ranges referenced in the agent reviews; do not invent new line numbers.
