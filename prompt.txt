## IMPORTANT Instructions
pr.diff: Diff of PR code changes containing new hunks annotated with line numbers, as well as old hunks representing replaced code, between branch `${BASE_BRANCH}` and `${HEAD_BRANCH}` (PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}).
Hunks may include incomplete code fragments.

Task: Review the code changes using the pr.diff file you should read the pr.diff file and understand the changes. Focus your review on these changes; however, if additional context is needed to understand or evaluate the changes, you may reference related code such as function or class definitions and their usage in the codebase.
Output: Write a review in Markdown format in review.md file in `${{ inputs.language }}` language, specifying exact line number ranges within the new hunks.
        Review should include
        1) Explain what this PR does
        2) Code review and suggestions for improvement
        3) Detect bugs and potential bugs.
        Ensure that the start and end line numbers fall within the same hunk; for single-line comments, set start and end to the same line number. Follow the example response format below.
        - Use fenced code blocks with the appropriate language identifier where applicable.
        - Do not annotate code snippets themselves with line numbers. Ensure code is properly formatted and indented. 
        - Do not use `suggestion` code blocks. 
        - For fix suggestions, use `diff` code blocks, marking removed lines with `-` and added lines with `+`. The line number range specified for comments with fix snippets must exactly match the lines replaced in the new hunk. 
        - If no issues are found within a specified line range, respond with the text `LGTM!` for that range in the review section.
