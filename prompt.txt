## IMPORTANT Instructions
pr.diff: Diff of PR code changes containing new hunks annotated with line numbers, as well as old hunks representing replaced code, between branch `${BASE_BRANCH}` and `${HEAD_BRANCH}` (PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}).
Hunks may include incomplete code fragments.
Before proceeding, check if an `AGENTS.md` file exists in the repository. If it does, use it as an additional guide. If not, continue with this prompt.

Task: Review the code changes using the pr.diff file you should read the pr.diff file and understand the changes. Focus your review on these changes; however, if additional context is needed to understand or evaluate the changes, you may reference related code such as function or class definitions and their usage in the codebase.
Output: Write a review in Markdown format in review.md file in LANGUAGE, specifying exact line number ranges within the new hunks.
        Review should include
        1) Explain what this PR does
        2) Code review and suggestions for improvement
        3) Detect bugs and potential bugs.
        Ensure that the start and end line numbers fall within the same hunk; for single-line comments, set start and end to the same line number. Follow the below rules.
        - Do not use any fenced code blocks (```).
        - Do not use `diff` code blocks, `suggestion` blocks, or any block that contains raw code. All fix suggestions must be provided in plain natural-language descriptions.
        - When referring to locations to change, specify file paths and line ranges, but do NOT include inline code snippets or code blocks — describe the change in prose (what to remove, rename, or change, and why).
        - Do not annotate code snippets themselves with line numbers. Ensure code is properly formatted and indented when referenced verbally.
        - If no issues are found within a specified line range, you don't need to write anything for that range.
